The files are pretty obviously named:

18-64.png means it's the full-sized map of ages 18-64, raw difference between single men and single women
18-64-adj.png means it's the full-sized map of ages 18-64, population-adjusted difference between single men and single women
*-500.png means it's 500 pixels wide, nice and blog sized.

FACTS:
Single is counted as being never married, divorced or widowed. Married is married.
After the mid 40's, there are a ton more women. Before that, the singles are mostly men.
Around 1/3 of 20-24 year old women are married, compared to 1/5th for guys. That means a given girl is 1.6 times more likely to be married than a guy. But really i think the numbers are something more like 30% vs. 20%, so it's much more like 50% more likely.
In times when the gender is mixed, men are mostly on the West Coast and women are in the east (not necessarily the coast - it's kind of Appalachians-y)
The only two places with a surplus of women in the 20-29 age bracket are New Orleans, LA and Springfield, MA. Lynchburg, VA pops up, if you lower the minimum required population.
The switchover from extra men to extra women starts at 35-39 for most big East Coast cities, but doesn't hit New York until 40-44.
Reno, NV is the main male holdout after the age of 45.
Homosexuality skews this towards there being the appearance of more single men than there actually are.
Data is from the Census's 2006 American Community Survey
